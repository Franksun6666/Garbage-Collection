    "Almost all modern programming languages make use of `dynamic memory allocation`. This allows objects to be allocated and deallocated even if their total size was not known at the time that the program was compiled, and if their lifetime may exceed that of the subroutine activation that allocated them. A dynamically allocated object is stored in a heap, rather than on the stack (in the activation record or stack frame of the procedure that allocated it) or statically (whereby the name of an object is bound to a storage location known at compile or link time). \n",
    "\n",
    "Heap allocation is particularly important because it allows the programmer to:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. choose dynamically the size of new objects (thus avoiding program failure through exceeding hard-coded limits on arrays);\n",
    "    2. deÔ¨Åne and use recursive data structures such as lists, trees and maps;\n",

    "`Roots:` Typically refer to objects that are directly accessible or referenced by the interpreter, e.g registers, thread stacks, global variables. These objects serve as starting points for the garbage collector to traverse the object graph and determine which objects are reachable and which ones are unreachable for the purpose of memory management. `Any object reference from a variable is a root.`\n",
    "\n",
    "`Dangling references: ` Pointers or references in a program that point to memory locations that have been deallocated, released, or otherwise invalidated. In simpler terms, they are references that are left \"hanging\" without a valid target. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's 3 possible scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Deallocated Memory: If memory allocated for an object is freed or deallocated, but there are still pointers or references pointing to that memory location, those pointers become dangling references.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Out-of-Scope References: In languages like C or C++, if a pointer to an object is stored in a local variable within a function and that function returns, the local variable goes out of scope, but if the pointer is still accessed or used elsewhere, it becomes a dangling reference because it points to memory that may have been reused for other purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Object Ownership: In languages without garbage collection, if an object is manually deallocated while other parts of the program still hold references to it, those references become dangling.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Strong Reference:` A strong reference is a direct reference to an object that prevents it from being garbage-collected. As long as there is at least one strong reference to an object, the garbage collector considers it \"alive\" and will not reclaim its memory. Most references in programming are strong references by default. For example, in languages like Java and C#, simply declaring and assigning an object to a variable creates a strong reference. These references ensure that the object remains in memory throughout its use, preventing it from being collected prematurely.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Weak Reference:` A weak reference, on the other hand, does not prevent the garbage collector from reclaiming the object it points to. This means that an object with only weak references is eligible for garbage collection and can be collected at any time when the system runs a garbage collection cycle. Weak references are useful in situations where you need a reference to an object without preventing it from being garbage-collected, which is especially valuable in scenarios involving caching, listeners, or large data structures where memory management is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Unowned reference`: They are similar to weak references, but they are used when the other instance has the same or longer lifetime. An unowned reference is expected not to become nil once assigned, unlike a weak reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Mutators:` These are essentially the application threads that run the main logic of the program. A mutator modifies the heap memory by allocating new objects and potentially making some objects unreachable. The term \"mutator\" is used because these threads mutate the state of the memory, continually changing which objects are accessible and which are not.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Collectors:` These are part of the garbage collection system. A collector's job is to identify memory that is no longer in use and can be reclaimed. The collector operates in its own thread or set of threads separate from those of the application. It scans the memory, marks unused objects, and eventually deallocates or recycles this memory, making it available for future use.\n",

    "Manipulating all reference counts is expensive compared with the cost to the mutator of simple tracing algorithms. Most high-performance reference counting systems use deferred reference counting. The overwhelming majority of pointer loads are to local and temporary variables, that is, to registers or stack slots. A way to reduce this overhead is to keep only an approximate count: pointer stores to local variables do not update the count, `only stores to the heap do`; the count reflects then the number of heap pointers only. The deferred aspect means that updates to the reference count and the associated garbage collection are not performed immediately but are `deferred` to a later time, which can help in optimizing performance especially in `concurrent execution environments`. If the count reaches zero, then the stack has to be scanned to check if local variables are pointing to the object before it can be recycled. This can be deferred by placing objects with zero count in a zero count table first and scanning that table periodically as shown in **Algorithm 5.2**."

    "Objects that are reachable are typically marked using a flag or a bit in their header to indicate that they are still in use.\n",

    "The sweep phase involves traversing the entire heap (memory space allocated for objects) and deallocating memory for objects that are not marked as reachable.\n",
    "The algorithm scans through each memory block, checking whether the corresponding object is marked. If it's marked, it means the object is still in use, so the mark is cleared. If it's not marked, it means the object is no longer reachable and can be safely deallocated.\n",

    "\n",
    "The mark-sweep interface with the mutator is very simple. If a thread is unable to allocate a new object, the collector is called and the allocation request is retried (**Algorithm 2.1**). To emphasize that the collector operates in stop-the-world mode, without concurrent execution of the mutator threads, we mark the collect routine with the `atomic` keyword. If there's still insufficient memory available to meet the allocation request, then heap memory is exhausted. Often this is a fatal error. However, in some languages, New may raise an exception in this circumstance that the programmer may be able to catch. If memory can be released by deleting references (for example, to cached data structures which could be recreated later if necessary), then the allocation request could be repeated."

    "The mark-compact algorithm has its origins in the early days of automated memory management research, emerging as an important technique during the 1960s and 1970s. One of the key motivations for developing this method was to address the fragmentation issues associated with the mark-sweep approach, where memory could become increasingly fragmented over time, leading to inefficient use of space and potential program failure due to insufficient contiguous memory blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The development of the mark-compact algorithm is often associated with efforts to optimize garbage collection for systems with limited memory resources where maximizing the utilization of available memory was crucial. Its introduction allowed for more efficient and reliable performance in systems that handle large data or have long runtimes, making it a valuable addition to the repertoire of garbage collection techniques.

    "`Java`: Java is one of the most prominent users of generational garbage collection. Java virtual machines (JVMs) typically use a young generation where most new objects are allocated and a copying collector is employed because it's efficient for managing short-lived objects. For the old generation, which houses objects that have survived multiple garbage collection cycles, more thorough methods like mark-compact or mark-sweep are used because these objects are less likely to be garbage and more expensive to collect.\n",

    "The concept of generational garbage collection was first formulated and put into practice in the 1980s. One of the seminal works that proposed the use of generational collection was by Lieberman and Hewitt in 1983. They suggested that most objects die young, which was a pivotal observation that led to the development of this technique. The idea was to optimize garbage collection by collecting the young generation more frequently and using faster, less intensive collection methods due to the high mortality rate of young objects, while employing more thorough collection methods for the older generation where objects are less likely to be garbage and more costly in terms of performance to collect.\n",
    "\n",
    "The adoption of generational garbage collection has significantly impacted the development of programming languages and applications, allowing for more efficient memory management, reduced GC pause times, and overall better performance, especially in memory-intensive applications. This method reflects an ongoing evolution in garbage collection technologies, aimed at balancing performance with efficient resource management in complex computing environments.
